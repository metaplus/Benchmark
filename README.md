# Benchmark
Prototype tests and data analysis. Projects under this repository 
implement specific components, which would be geared into the intact 
system of other git repos.   
## Note
Resource allocation and management, e.g. memory model, thread 
management, etc. is not extremely optimized, which is 
subject to the customized usecases and dedicated policy. 
The main purpose of projects are to contrast several approaches in 
the fixed and fair condition, measuring the space efficiency and time 
elapsed.
