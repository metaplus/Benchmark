# Benchmark
Prototype tests and data analysis. Projects under this repository 
implement specific components, which would be geared into the intact 
system of other git repos.   
## Note
Resource allocation and management, e.g. memory model, thread 
management, etc. is not extremely optimized, which is 
subject to the customized usecases and dedicated policy. 
Class hierarchy and interface heritance don't bother much in these 
prototypes, as slight as the burden of external dependence.  
The main purpose of projects are to contrast several approaches in 
the fixed and fair condition, measuring the space efficiency, thoughput 
or the time consumed.
## Environment
* CPU i7-6700k (clocked @4.6Ghz)
* Memory 16GB 3000Mhz XMP
* Disk SSD 250MBps serial IO
